# Heroku-MEAN-Stack-Example

This project is a Mongo, Express, Angular, Node application build on the Heroku platform. With this stack you are able to build a simple application with create/read/update/delete (CRUD) functionality, the basic functions of persistent storage. This functionality allows us to build a rest API server and with Angular, display a single page application.
